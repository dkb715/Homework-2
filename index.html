           <p>    My name is Donavan Brown, I'm from Central Jersey and I recently Graduated from Temple University as a finance major with an entrepreneurship minor. 
          As a graduate I worked for North Western Mutual for about a month before I realized the corporate life wasnt the right fit for me. 
           Ive always been intrigued by programming and the coding language but there was never a right time to start learning. 
           I picked up a computer science certificate Sophomore year of college before dropping it for the Entrepreneurship minor. 
           This was because in order to graduate on time I would've had to pay for 2 summer classes. 
           I saw UPENNs coding bootcamp online a couple of months after I quit North Western, and saw it as a chance to finally learn code. 
            </p>
            
          <p> I'm very excited to learn code and will be updating this page frequently as I expand my knowledge in programming. This is just the begining. 
            I enjoy going to the gym, playing sports, and reading. I'm an option trader and I teach myself about the stock and crypto markets. 
            When I have the time I enjoy photography and playing Xbox.  
            Im an Eagles fan and a "LeBron=Goat" advocate. 
            Thanks for visiting my page!!!</p>
